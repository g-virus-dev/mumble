# Mumble - Open Source voice-chat software

Mumble is an Open Source, low-latency and high-quality voice-chat program
written on top of Qt and Opus.

There are two modules in Mumble; the client (mumble) and the server (mumble-server formerly known as murmur).
The client works on Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and macOS,
while the server should work on anything Qt can be installed on.

The documentation of the project can be found on [the website](https://www.mumble.info/documentation/).


## A modified version of Mumble

This repository contains a modified version of the original Mumble. This version has extra features and less dependencies compared to the original software, and all the changes from the upstream are being synchronized as well. This version will not be merged into the original repo, at least by me.

For the original Mumble please refer to its [repo](https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble).
